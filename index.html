<p><strong>The video game “Looney Tunes: Rabbit Rampage,” which was launched in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, is where the meme “Big Chungus” first appeared. A character dubbed Bugs Bunny makes an appearance in the game in an obese and twisted form, which served as the inspiration for the meme.

The meme consists of pictures of Bugs Bunny dressed as “Big Chungus,” sometimes with amusing remarks or modified versions of the original game.<strong></p>
